Feedback2me

This project brings teachers (masters) and students (juniors) together so that students can get feedback on the topics that they want to improve themselves. This platform enables students to upload their materials (video, voice record, text (essay), code) and get feedback online. Teachers are able to choose what they want to evaluate and give feedback by putting remarks on the materials or editing and re-uploading the corrected versions of them.
